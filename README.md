# Binary Exploitation

#### Any Doubt...? [Let's Discuss](https://gitter.im/BinaryExploitation/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)
> ## Introduction
> I am quite passionate about exploiting binary files. The first time when I came across Buffer Overflow(a simple technique of exploitation), then I was not able to implement the same with the same copy of code on my system.
The reason for that was there was no consolidated document that would guide me thoroughly to write a perfect exploit payload for the program in case of system changes.
> Also, there are very few descriptive blogs/tutorials that had helped me exploiting a given binary.
> I have come up with the consolidation of Modern exploitation techniques (in the form of the tutorial) that will allow you to understand exploitation from scratch.

I will be using [vagrant file](Vagrantfile) to set up the system on a virtual box. To do  the same in your system follow:
1. `vagrant up`
2. `vagrant ssh`
